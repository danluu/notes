Notes from reading H&P's Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (5ed)

* Questions
** Chapter 1  
  Why does gate vs. interconnect delay scale the way it does?
  For interconnect, naively, both dimensions shrink, so resistance goes up by S^2
  But length shrinks by S, reducing R by S, and also reducing the C we need to charge?

  For gates, channel shrinks, and so does the capacitance at both ends. 

  When does it make sense to sleep to halt (run very fast so we can enter a low p-state)?
